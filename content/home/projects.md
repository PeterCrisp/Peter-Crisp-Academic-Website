My researches focuses on DNA methylation, which is known to underlie epigenetic control of some traits and is often - but not universally - stably inherited in plants. There are many unanswered questions concerning the origin, inheritance, stability and functional relevance of epialleles in large crop genomes.  These questions are critical for a complete understanding of fundamental principles of genetics and will greatly affect the potential application and utility of epigenetic information for plant breeding and modern agriculture.
