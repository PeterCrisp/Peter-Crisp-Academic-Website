# Epigenomics in crops

The guiding paradigm for my research is understanding the contribution of epigenetics to heritable phenotypic variation in crop plants.  Epigenetics refers to the heritable transmission of information that is not solely due to DNA sequence.  My goal is to understand the role of epigenetics in trait variation in plants and learning when, how and why epigenetic traits (“epialleles”) can be passed through cell divisions to daughter cells or across generations.
